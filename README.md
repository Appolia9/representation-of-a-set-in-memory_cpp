It is necessary to calculate the set containing the operations available in A, also simultaneously in B and C, and all operations from D.\
Formalization of the task:  E = A ˄ B ˄ C ˅ D.\
**An array, a list, a machine word,** and **a bit vector** are used as representation methods.
The evaluation is based on the measurement of the task completion time.
